# meant4test

Hi!, welcome to my form test. Since i have been somewhat busy i wasn't really able to do it before but and i'm not sure why but the endpoint of the api was working fine the first day i started the project, but as of today (28 sept) it kept sending me a 400 error, teeling me that the "Max number of elements reached for this resource!".

The form validation works using vuelidate. I made a checkbox to switch the autovalidation on and off while typing (Validation typing) and made another to switch between dark mode and light mode (Who the heck likes light mode right?)

As for the test, i used some basic validation using jest to test the screen errors.

And finally, the commands to run it:

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Run your unit tests
```
npm run test:unit
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
